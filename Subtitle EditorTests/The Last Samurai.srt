
2
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:30,188
<i>They say Japan was made
by a sword. </i>

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,738
<i>They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean... </i>

4
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,703
<i>... and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea... </i>

5
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,325
<i>... and those drops became
the islands of Japan. </i>

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,423
<i>I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men... </i>

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,507
<i>... warriors willing to give their lives... </i>

8
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,384
<i>... for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:</i>

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,053
<i>Honor. </i>

10
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,815
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

11
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,604
America's leader in all forms
of armament used...

12
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:03,351
... by the United States Army...

13
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:08,503
... celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

14
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:13,840
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

15
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,806
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry...

16
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,251
... on the hallowed ground
of Gettysburg.

17
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,711
San Francisco, 1876

18
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,725
He is late of the 7th Cavalry...

19
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:28,021
... and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the Indian nations.

20
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,524
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:

21
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,819
Captain Nathan Algren!

22
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:47,246
Captain Nathan Algren!

23
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:49,243
Yes!

24
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,697
Yes!

25
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,790
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,837
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

27
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,220
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

28
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,344
Come on! I'm sick of this!

29
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,839
Come on!

30
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,425
Yes!

31
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:23,443
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

32
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:28,117
This, ladies and gents...

33
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:31,369
... is the gun that's winning the West.

34
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:34,705
Why.. many's the time
I've found myself...

35
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,959
... surrounded by a swarm of...

36
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,171
... angry hostiles...

37
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:47,011
... with nothing but this rifle...

38
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:51,839
... between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

39
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,303
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

40
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,516
... is a fearsome enemy.

41
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,479
And if he'd had his way...

42
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:03,981
... why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone...

43
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,734
... and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

44
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:16,197
Like those poor bastards out there...

45
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,989
... on the Little Bighorn.

46
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,248
Bodies stripped bare...

47
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:26,330
... mutilated.

48
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,087
Left to rot in the sun.

49
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,679
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

50
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,677
... Trapper.

51
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,437
It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.

52
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,982
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

53
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,021
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

54
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,524
That's right, missy.

55
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,572
This beauty.

56
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,236
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

57
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:04,278
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

58
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:24,260
My thanks on behalf
of those who died...

59
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:28,051
... in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

60
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,554
... and commercial opportunities.

61
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,234
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

62
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,726
God bless you all.

63
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,743
I must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

64
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:51,246
- You're alive.
- I am, indeed.

65
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:55,492
Your man Custer says to me,
''We're going to the Little Bighorn. ''

66
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,086
Says I, ''What's this 'we' stuff?''
It's the walking ticket for me.

67
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,044
Nine lives I have.
but I'll tell you what else I have.

68
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,210
I have a good job for the both of us.

69
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:07,056
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

70
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:09,262
What kind of a job?

71
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:14,225
The only job you're fit for, boy-yo.
A man's job.

72
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:19,270
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

73
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:24,981
Nathan!

74
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,444
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

75
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,609
Been a while.
It's good to see you.

76
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,740
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan...

77
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:36,744
... and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.

78
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,197
Sit down, please.

79
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,286
Whiskey.

80
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:50,918
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

81
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,966
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes...

82
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,809
... to hire white experts
to train their army.

83
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,969
And if we play our cards right...

84
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:02,763
... the Emperor grants the U. S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

85
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:12,653
Well, I have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

86
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:16,109
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

87
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:21,701
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

88
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,543
We will pay you $400 a month.

89
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:32,079
Five. For each.

90
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:36,750
And another 500
when we get the job done.

91
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:41,808
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

92
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,012
He's rude.

93
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:48,472
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.

94
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,179
Whiskey.

95
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:53,229
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

96
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:57,988
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

97
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,322
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?

98
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,819
The word you might use is ''warrior. ''

99
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:07,578
Mr. Omura is familiar with our
experiences dealing with renegades.

100
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,658
Is he?

101
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,494
He's even read your book.

102
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,792
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...

103
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:16,881
... was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

104
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,808
Please excuse. What is funny?

105
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:39,567
The corps back together again.
It's just so...

106
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,775
... inspiring!

107
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,452
Excuse me.

108
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,988
I need to use the necessities.

109
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:01,582
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

110
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,251
Colonel Bagley.

111
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:07,008
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer...

112
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,628
... and you assured us
of his participation.

113
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:13,056
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.

114
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,978
Nathan.

115
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,768
I did what I was ordered
to do out there.

116
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,818
And I have no remorse.

117
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:27,853
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

118
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,909
You want me to kill Jappos,
I'll kill Jappos.

119
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,115
- I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
- You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos...

120
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,833
... I'll kill the enemies of Jappos.

121
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,709
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne... .

122
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,378
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.

123
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:49,964
but keep one thing in mind...

124
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,381
... I'd happily kill you for free.

125
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,774
<i>July 12th, 1876. </i>

126
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,521
<i>There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea. </i>

127
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,158
<i>No past, no future. </i>

128
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:26,375
<i>And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances. </i>

129
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:34,707
<i>I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader. </i>

130
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,632
<i>Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited. </i>

131
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,887
<i>I am beset by the ironies of my life. </i>

132
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:21,459
Yokohama Harbor, 1876

133
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,454
- Captain Algren, I presume?
- Yes.

134
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:00,082
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

135
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,748
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

136
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,252
Now look at it.

137
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,628
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western...

138
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,840
... and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

139
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:15,099
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

140
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,268
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in...

141
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,643
... every Western expert he can get.

142
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:24,728
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland...

143
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:28,317
... and now, of course,
warriors from America.

144
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:33,066
I came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

145
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,116
I was soon relieved of my position.

146
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,859
I had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth...

147
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,825
... in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,376
So now, I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

149
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,836
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

150
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:58,590
You have to realize what an honor this
is. It's all highly ritualized, of course.

151
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,636
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

152
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,808
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.

153
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,017
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.

154
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:12,351
Rather snug around the midriff.

155
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,369
And bow.

156
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,587
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

157
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:37,006
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

158
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,250
We hope to accomplish
the same national harmony...

159
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,836
... you enjoy in your homeland.

160
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:53,606
The Emperor is most interested
in your American Indians...

161
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:56,182
... if you have fought
against them in battle.

162
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,480
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

163
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,154
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren...

164
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:13,036
... if it is true they wear eagle feathers...

165
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,245
... and paint their faces
before going into battle...

166
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,626
... and that they have no fear.

167
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,543
They are very brave.

168
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,637
Bow.

169
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:45,233
Thank you very much.

170
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:58,952
And step back.

171
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,581
Step back, step back and turn.

172
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:10,041
Right, you little bastards!

173
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:13,884
You will stand up straight
or I will personally shit-kick...

174
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,555
... every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

175
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,431
Well done, sergeant.

176
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,808
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

177
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,819
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

178
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,392
The second rank... .

179
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,572
<i>July 22nd, 1876. </i>

180
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:38,986
<i>For six months ' work, I am to receive
three years of captain 's pay... </i>

181
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,784
<i>... teaching Orientals to soldier. </i>

182
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,993
<i>They are an army of conscripts. </i>

183
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,170
<i>Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun. </i>

184
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,963
Fire!

185
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:55,633
<i>They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature... </i>

186
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,590
<i>... who nonetheless commands
enormous respect. </i>

187
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:02,761
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

188
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:11,348
<i>He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion. </i>

189
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,063
<i>I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai. </i>

190
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,063
Who supplies their weapons?

191
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:27,696
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

192
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,875
He uses no firearms?

193
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,960
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

194
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:34,879
How well does he know him?

195
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,297
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

196
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,878
He fought with the Samurai?

197
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,793
He is Samurai.

198
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:53,562
You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword...

199
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,011
... to defend the Emperor.

200
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,812
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

201
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,693
Samurai are paradoxical.

202
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:02,815
I've tried to write about them,
but they keep to themselves.

203
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,527
The bastards are still wearing armor.

204
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,867
When the Irish were comporting
themselves in loincloths...

205
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:12,239
... these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

206
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,537
I need information
on their battle tactics.

207
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,870
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

208
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,203
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.

209
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,456
You should hear him blather on
in Blackfoot.

210
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,126
Really?

211
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:27,087
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

212
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:30,512
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

213
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:34,216
Just ''hello'' or ''goodbye'' or--
No, no, no!

214
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,849
''Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil. ''

215
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:41,389
Early day tomorrow, captain.

216
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:45,398
- It's about bedtime, isn't it?
- I always had a fascination with scalping.

217
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,405
I never quite understood
its technique.

218
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:57,948
imagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

219
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:03,124
... grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless...

220
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:12,501
... and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp...

221
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:14,967
... with a saw-like motion.

222
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:20,759
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

223
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:25,437
... on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles...

224
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:28,358
... would have on your nervous system.

225
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:36,272
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped...

226
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,905
... Mr. Graham.

227
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,575
How soon can you
translate those books?

228
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,788
Right away.

229
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,375
I'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

230
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,967
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

231
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,554
I shall not sleep until it is done.

232
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,804
Sake.

233
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,306
I bid you good night.

234
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,637
Can I get you anything?

235
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,856
<i>This is a punitive expedition, captain. </i>

236
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:18,193
Col. Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

237
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,985
- Good night, sir.
- Quietly now, boys.

238
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,939
Fire!

239
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,786
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

240
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:23,204
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

241
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,963
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

242
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:34,178
Eye, down the sight.

243
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,058
Now, slowly... .

244
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:42,558
Well done.

245
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,436
Nathan!

246
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:52,566
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

247
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:55,908
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

248
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,358
He must be stopped now.

249
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,155
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

250
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,613
They're not ready.

251
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,576
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

252
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:10,414
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

253
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,339
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

254
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:18,049
I am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

255
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:21,556
You will track him down
and engage him.

256
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:26,385
Load.

257
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,933
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

258
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,608
- I beg your pardon?
- Tell this man...

259
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,314
... if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!

260
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:41,610
- Captain, if I might have a word.
- Tell him!

261
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:44,787
Tell him!

262
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,461
Load!

263
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,126
Load!

264
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,419
Faster!

265
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,003
Faster!

266
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,970
Shoot me, damn it.

267
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,145
Fire!

268
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:21,393
Fire!

269
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:49,252
They're not ready.

270
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,675
The regiment leaves at 6 a. m. !

271
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:29,670
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

272
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,503
It's astonishing.

273
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,754
And Omura owns all of it?

274
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:36,931
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

275
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,638
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?

276
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:44,354
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.

277
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,647
Move into position!

278
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:58,107
Yoshino Province, 1876

279
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:00,611
1 st Company,
form a battle line on me!

280
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,781
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

281
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:05,578
2nd Company,
form on 1 st Company.

282
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,077
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

283
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:09,796
Fill in on command!

284
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:13,795
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

285
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,754
- Cover down!
- Captain Algren.

286
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:21,431
We are not here as combatants.

287
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,220
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.

288
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:27,180
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.

289
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,890
Fix bayonets!

290
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:37,528
- Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
- Yes, of course.

291
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:47,243
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

292
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:50,280
- Did you hear my order?
- I did indeed, sir!

293
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,784
Then you will obey it. Now!

294
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:56,330
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

295
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:04,292
- Load!
- Load!

296
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,361
Samurai come.

297
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,614
You'll be fine, son.

298
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:57,223
- Assume firing positions!
- Assume firing positions!

299
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:13,232
Fire on my order only!

300
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,388
Hold your fire!

301
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:39,099
Hold your fire!

302
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,147
Reload!

303
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,188
Hold the line!

304
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,698
Fire at will!

305
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,250
Lieutenant, fall back!

306
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,041
Zeb!

307
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:41,216
He's mine.

308
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,786
Stop!

309
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,168
Take him away!

310
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:27,543
What is your name?

311
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,623
insolent swine! Answer!

312
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:46,427
Leave him be.

313
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:57,278
This is my son's village.

314
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:01,147
We are deep in the mountains and
winter is coming. You cannot escape.

315
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,077
Jolly good.

316
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,189
My Lord, why do you spare
the barbarian?

317
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,937
He is shamed in defeat.

318
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,531
He should kill himself.

319
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,988
That is not their custom.

320
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,957
Then...

321
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,207
... I will kill him.

322
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,955
Father... .

323
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,919
I don't think... .

324
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,793
Ujio...

325
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,885
... there will be plenty of killing to come.

326
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,678
For now...

327
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:43,598
... we will learn about our new enemy.

328
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,967
Keep him alive.

329
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,109
He's in bad shape.

330
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,850
Sake.

331
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:02,073
Sake?

332
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:04,530
Sake.

333
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,196
Sake.

334
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,250
Taka will take care of you.

335
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:17,003
Sake.

336
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:18,553
Sake.

337
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:22,344
Sake!

338
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:25,144
Let him drink, Aunt.

339
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,109
No. That will not do.

340
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:28,522
This is my village.

341
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:30,818
This is my house.

342
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,029
Please.

343
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:38,947
Sake.

344
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:51,043
Sake!

345
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:00,348
No!

346
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:03,592
No!

347
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,481
I told you!

348
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:19,778
No!

349
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,901
Morning.

350
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:57,718
Over there!

351
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,722
Go. You, go.

352
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,842
What's your name?

353
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,301
You got a name, don't you?

354
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,686
You don't know what I'm saying,
do you?

355
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,562
I know why you don't talk.

356
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,564
You're angry.

357
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:21,775
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

358
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:24,607
Son of a bitch.

359
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:07,570
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

360
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:12,525
My name is Katsumoto.

361
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:15,582
What is your name?

362
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:24,381
Are my words not correct?

363
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:31,798
I will practice my English with you...

364
00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:35,139
... if you would honor me.

365
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:39,094
You kept me alive just to speak English?

366
00:42:41,273 --> 00:42:43,099
Then what do you want?

367
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,681
To know my enemy.

368
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:49,941
I've seen what you do to your enemies.

369
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,273
Warriors in your country do not kill?

370
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,699
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

371
00:42:56,745 --> 00:43:00,445
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

372
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,327
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

373
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:08,293
I was honored to cut off his head.

374
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:16,169
Many of our customs seem strange
to you. The same is true of yours.

375
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:17,888
For example...

376
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:23,014
... not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

377
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,608
Nathan Algren.

378
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,526
I am honored to meet you.

379
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:41,071
- I enjoyed this conversation in English.
- I have questions.

380
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,909
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

381
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,204
This is a very good conversation.

382
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,790
- I have questions.
- They come later.

383
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,332
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

384
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,003
- My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
- And the woman who cares for me?

385
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,005
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

386
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,756
Her name is Taka.

387
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:03,335
I killed her husband?

388
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:07,472
It was a good death.

389
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:21,727
You!

390
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:26,200
You! Come... . Please... .

391
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,801
Thank you.

392
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:09,234
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother I cannot stand this.

393
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,730
Why don't you tell him?

394
00:45:10,993 --> 00:45:12,950
At least make him take a bath.

395
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,222
Nicely done.

396
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,515
They may be children,
but they are strong.

397
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:27,968
You try.

398
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:30,392
Try.

399
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:12,133
Put down the sword.

400
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:43,867
I just realized, I've been remiss.
Forgive me.

401
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:47,659
I have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

402
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:50,203
That is your job, correct?

403
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,326
Protecting me?

404
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,333
Well done, Bob.

405
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:58,162
You don't mind if I call you ''Bob, ''
do you?

406
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:02,795
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

407
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:05,718
You a ladies' man, Bob?

408
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:13,515
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

409
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,932
Yes, indeed.

410
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:22,517
You fought against your Red Indians?

411
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,480
Yes.

412
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,402
Tell me of your part in this war.

413
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:32,155
- Why?
- I wish to learn.

414
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,662
- Read a book.
- I would rather have a good conversation.

415
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,872
- Why?
- Because...

416
00:50:38,043 --> 00:50:39,916
... we are both students of war.

417
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:48,801
So...

418
00:50:50,054 --> 00:50:52,591
... you were the general of your army?

419
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:56,475
No.

420
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,093
I was a captain.

421
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,561
This is a low rank?

422
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,727
A middle rank.

423
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:09,315
And who was your general?

424
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,858
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

425
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:20,370
People in your country
do not like conversation?

426
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,947
He was a lieutenant colonel.

427
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:25,334
His name was Custer.

428
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:26,783
I know this name.

429
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,247
He killed many warriors.

430
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,083
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

431
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:33,416
So he was a good general.

432
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:37,128
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

433
00:51:37,388 --> 00:51:41,682
He got massacred because he took
a battalion against 2000 angry Indians.

434
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:44,592
Two thousand Indians?

435
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,301
How many men for Custer?

436
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,141
Two hundred and eleven.

437
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:51,565
I like this General Custer.

438
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,155
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

439
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:58,445
And his troopers died for it.

440
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,692
I think this is a very good death.

441
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,861
Maybe you can have one
like it someday.

442
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,202
If it is in my destiny.

443
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,159
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?

444
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,205
What are you doing?

445
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,503
Why are we having these conversations?

446
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:18,629
What the hell am I doing here?

447
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:25,384
in spring...

448
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:28,973
... the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

449
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:33,481
Until that time, you are here.

450
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:38,068
Good day, captain.

451
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,915
<i> 1876. </i>

452
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,293
<i>Day unknown. Month unknown. </i>

453
00:53:05,344 --> 00:53:09,009
<i>I continue to live among
these unusual people. </i>

454
00:53:10,265 --> 00:53:13,468
<i>I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape. </i>

455
00:53:15,436 --> 00:53:18,141
<i>Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect... </i>

456
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:23,643
<i>... as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest. </i>

457
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:38,454
<i>Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows. </i>

458
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:44,835
<i>But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling. </i>

459
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:27,119
<i>They are an intriguing people. </i>

460
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:29,252
<i>From the moment they wake... </i>

461
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:33,418
<i>... they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue. </i>

462
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:44,928
<i>I have never seen such discipline. </i>

463
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,147
<i>I am surprised to learn that the word
''Samurai'' means ''to serve''... </i>

464
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:52,806
<i>... and that Katsumoto believes
his rebellion to be... </i>

465
00:54:52,984 --> 00:54:54,893
<i>... in the service of the Emperor. </i>

466
00:56:56,722 --> 00:56:59,392
Please forgive. Too many mind.

467
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:02,601
Too many mind?

468
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:07,438
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

469
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:10,066
Too many mind.

470
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,308
No mind.

471
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:16,900
No mind.

472
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:49,143
Thank you. More rice?

473
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:54,147
Taka. He spoke Japanese!

474
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:58,151
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.

475
00:57:58,613 --> 00:58:00,984
Not so fast. What are these?

476
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,658
How can he understand?

477
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,708
Top knot.

478
00:58:16,962 --> 00:58:18,338
No, no. Not so fast.

479
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:23,789
I'm Algren.

480
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,394
- Nobutada.
- Nobutada.

481
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:37,013
- Magojiro.
- Magojiro.

482
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,470
Higen.

483
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:40,483
Higen.

484
00:58:44,071 --> 00:58:45,399
Taka.

485
00:58:48,616 --> 00:58:52,032
Brother, please make him leave.
I cannot stand it.

486
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,238
Is he so repulsive?

487
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,663
The shame is unbearable.
I ask permission to end my life.

488
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:00,163
You will do as you are told!

489
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:09,170
You'd rather I kill him
to avenge your husband?

490
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:10,968
Yes.

491
00:59:14,557 --> 00:59:17,807
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
It was karma.

492
00:59:17,977 --> 00:59:19,601
I know.

493
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:25,226
Forgive my weakness.

494
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:29,809
There must be some reason
why he is here.

495
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:35,533
It is beyond my understanding.

496
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:56,591
She's been very kind to me.

497
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:01,552
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

498
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,702
<i>Winter, 1877. </i>

499
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,593
<i>What does it mean to be Samurai?</i>

500
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:35,199
<i>To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles... </i>

501
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:38,842
<i>... to seek a stillness of your mind... </i>

502
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:42,744
<i>... and to master the way of the sword. </i>

503
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:44,547
He's getting better, no?

504
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,550
But still so ugly.

505
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,645
Cold?

506
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,815
Also. Also cold.

507
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:14,185
Fire.

508
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:24,353
To burn.

509
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,322
No, please.

510
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:48,970
Japanese men do not help with this.

511
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:52,724
I am not Japanese.

512
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,623
I'm sorry.

513
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:37,136
For your husband, Hirotaro.

514
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:54,807
He did his duty.

515
01:02:58,482 --> 01:03:02,431
You did your duty.

516
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:10,153
I accept your apology... .

517
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,304
<i>Spring, 1877. </i>

518
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:37,681
<i>This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 1 7. </i>

519
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:44,522
<i>There is so much here
that I'll never understand. </i>

520
01:03:48,904 --> 01:03:51,691
<i>I have never been a church-going man... </i>

521
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:54,154
<i>... and what I've seen
on the field of battle... </i>

522
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:56,284
<i>... has led me to question God's purpose. </i>

523
01:03:56,454 --> 01:03:58,826
<i>But there is, indeed, something... </i>

524
01:03:58,998 --> 01:04:02,034
<i>... spiritual in this place. </i>

525
01:04:05,337 --> 01:04:08,788
<i>And though it may forever
be obscure to me... </i>

526
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:12,416
<i>... I cannot but be aware of its power. </i>

527
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:25,851
<i>I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years. </i>

528
01:04:29,193 --> 01:04:32,146
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

529
01:04:32,321 --> 01:04:36,448
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

530
01:04:44,832 --> 01:04:47,158
Ujio will win in three moves.

531
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:51,415
In five!

532
01:05:05,894 --> 01:05:07,353
Next in five moves.

533
01:05:09,398 --> 01:05:10,678
In six.

534
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,452
No mind.

535
01:06:37,523 --> 01:06:38,803
A draw!

536
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,018
Who is this amateur?

537
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:28,412
Katsumoto!

538
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,666
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!

539
01:09:13,504 --> 01:09:14,914
Lord, please go inside!

540
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:58,735
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

541
01:11:58,911 --> 01:12:03,952
You could spend your life looking for
one, and it would not be a wasted life.

542
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,743
Who sent those men to kill you?

543
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:10,003
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.

544
01:12:10,504 --> 01:12:13,376
<i>The tiger's eyes are like my own</i>

545
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,752
<i>But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea</i>

546
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,505
Was it the Emperor?

547
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:22,628
Omura?

548
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:26,722
If the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

549
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,472
So it was Omura.

550
01:12:30,065 --> 01:12:32,223
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.

551
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,066
- Can you suggest a last line?
- I'm not a writer.

552
01:12:36,321 --> 01:12:41,316
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

553
01:12:43,786 --> 01:12:45,944
What else has she told you?

554
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:49,872
You have nightmares.

555
01:12:52,712 --> 01:12:54,254
Every soldier has nightmares.

556
01:12:54,422 --> 01:12:57,872
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

557
01:12:58,633 --> 01:13:01,837
You have no idea what I have done.

558
01:13:09,103 --> 01:13:12,269
You have seen many things.

559
01:13:13,064 --> 01:13:14,345
I have.

560
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:18,735
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

561
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:21,317
ls this not so?

562
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:26,439
- Yes.
- I, also.

563
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:31,414
It happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

564
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:37,414
And then I come to this place
of my ancestors...

565
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:39,705
... and I remember.

566
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:42,206
Like these blossoms...

567
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:44,965
... we are all dying.

568
01:13:46,847 --> 01:13:50,297
To know life in every breath...

569
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:53,265
... every cup of tea...

570
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:56,472
... every life we take.

571
01:13:56,648 --> 01:13:59,019
The way of the warrior.

572
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,397
Life in every breath.

573
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,727
That is Bushido.

574
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:12,653
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

575
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:15,370
We leave tomorrow.

576
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:19,662
Good.

577
01:14:20,753 --> 01:14:22,082
Good.

578
01:14:28,678 --> 01:14:31,632
When I took these, you were...

579
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,092
... my enemy.

580
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:56,283
Excuse me.

581
01:14:57,872 --> 01:15:01,074
No, so sorry, I am finishing.

582
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:20,849
I must go away.

583
01:15:42,832 --> 01:15:45,868
You have been kind to me.

584
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,753
I won't forget... .

585
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,237
Algren-san! Algren-san.

586
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:17,152
Algren?

587
01:19:17,327 --> 01:19:20,244
Algren, my God, you are alive.

588
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,788
Well, you never cease to astonish.

589
01:19:27,503 --> 01:19:31,251
- Howitzers.
- Yes, indeed.

590
01:19:31,423 --> 01:19:34,209
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement...

591
01:19:34,384 --> 01:19:36,460
... he gets the whole package.

592
01:19:36,637 --> 01:19:40,171
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

593
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:43,801
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

594
01:19:43,976 --> 01:19:45,720
I need a bath.

595
01:19:45,895 --> 01:19:49,477
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.

596
01:19:51,024 --> 01:19:53,231
Welcome back, captain.

597
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:05,240
You rise against me, my teacher.

598
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:08,446
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.

599
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:12,744
They are my advisors, like you.

600
01:20:12,959 --> 01:20:15,830
They advise in their own interest.

601
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:21,505
I need advisors who know
the modern world.

602
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:26,470
If I am no use,
I will happily end my life.

603
01:20:28,432 --> 01:20:29,926
No... .

604
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:33,430
I need your voice in the council.

605
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:35,845
It is your voice we need, Highness.

606
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:39,976
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.

607
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,856
I am a living god...

608
01:20:44,364 --> 01:20:47,946
... as long as I do
what they think is right.

609
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,319
What sad words you speak.

610
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:54,788
Forgive me for saying
what a teacher must.

611
01:20:56,459 --> 01:20:58,368
Have you forgotten your people?

612
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,541
Tell me what to do...

613
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:06,248
... my teacher.

614
01:21:11,181 --> 01:21:13,851
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.

615
01:21:15,143 --> 01:21:19,188
You must find the wisdom for all of us.

616
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:26,732
Gentlemen, come in.

617
01:21:27,237 --> 01:21:30,441
Captain Algren, it seems
you have endured your captivity...

618
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:31,897
... with little ill effect.

619
01:21:32,869 --> 01:21:34,411
I was not ill-treated, sir.

620
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:38,196
Mr. Omura, I have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

621
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:42,158
I'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

622
01:21:42,335 --> 01:21:43,747
I'm afraid I don't know.

623
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,290
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.

624
01:21:47,466 --> 01:21:51,712
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

625
01:21:51,886 --> 01:21:57,224
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

626
01:21:57,391 --> 01:22:01,342
- Sir, about the--
- I'm sure your documents are in order.

627
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,933
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.

628
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:10,485
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

629
01:22:10,653 --> 01:22:13,191
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

630
01:22:13,365 --> 01:22:15,736
With all due respect, ambassador...

631
01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:18,614
... perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

632
01:22:18,787 --> 01:22:21,574
For instance, the French
or the English.

633
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:24,868
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

634
01:22:26,586 --> 01:22:29,872
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

635
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:34,250
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

636
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,553
Perhaps you and I might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

637
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,935
- May I offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.

638
01:22:52,236 --> 01:22:55,402
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

639
01:22:55,572 --> 01:22:59,272
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.

640
01:22:59,451 --> 01:23:04,408
but none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

641
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:08,448
- I don't see how this concerns me.
- but it does.

642
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:13,868
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

643
01:23:14,047 --> 01:23:16,669
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

644
01:23:16,842 --> 01:23:18,799
but now, we are ready.

645
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:22,385
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause...

646
01:23:22,556 --> 01:23:27,383
... we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.

647
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:33,147
Either I'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

648
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:37,444
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

649
01:23:39,237 --> 01:23:42,772
- I appreciate the offer.
- It is not an offer.

650
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:47,614
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

651
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:50,279
Then we will make a new contract...

652
01:23:50,457 --> 01:23:53,873
... one that will recognize
the extraordinary contribution...

653
01:23:54,044 --> 01:23:55,668
... you've made to the Emperor.

654
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:58,459
Do we understand each other?

655
01:24:01,009 --> 01:24:04,959
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then I am pleased.

656
01:24:12,603 --> 01:24:17,348
Follow him. If he goes anywhere
near Katsumoto, kill him.

657
01:24:23,112 --> 01:24:25,948
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

658
01:24:26,116 --> 01:24:28,108
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

659
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:31,036
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

660
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:32,484
I need a drink.

661
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:37,041
ls your friend Katsumoto planning to go
up against the council this afternoon?

662
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:43,497
You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?

663
01:24:44,092 --> 01:24:45,336
My God, it's started.

664
01:24:45,717 --> 01:24:48,007
Hey boy, are you listening?

665
01:24:49,304 --> 01:24:51,213
No wonder the foreigners mock you.

666
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:52,764
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.

667
01:24:53,058 --> 01:24:54,434
Cut off his top knot.

668
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,089
Get down! Kneel!

669
01:24:56,269 --> 01:24:57,300
Captain Algren!

670
01:24:57,478 --> 01:24:58,510
Lower your weapons!

671
01:24:59,438 --> 01:25:01,064
Lower your weapons!

672
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:03,605
Who are you?

673
01:25:03,776 --> 01:25:05,104
I am Captain Algren.

674
01:25:07,489 --> 01:25:08,982
Stop!

675
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:34,549
Get down!

676
01:25:49,737 --> 01:25:51,528
Let's go.

677
01:26:08,004 --> 01:26:10,080
I'll take you home.

678
01:26:11,173 --> 01:26:12,834
Jolly good.

679
01:26:39,868 --> 01:26:41,906
We must resist the Western powers...

680
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:43,869
... by becoming powerful ourselves.

681
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:48,496
Our army, our economy,
must be strong.

682
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:55,338
Minister, you honor us.

683
01:26:57,843 --> 01:27:00,381
It is my honor to rejoin this council.

684
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:07,932
Perhaps you are unaware of the law
against wearing swords?

685
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:10,225
I read every law carefully.

686
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:13,848
Yet you bring weapons
into this chamber?

687
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:20,812
This chamber was protected
by my sword when--

688
01:27:20,989 --> 01:27:24,358
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.

689
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:27,239
We are a nation of whores,
selling ourselves--

690
01:27:27,413 --> 01:27:31,623
If we are whores,
the Samurai made us this way.

691
01:27:32,501 --> 01:27:36,628
I have not seen the Omura family
giving gold to the masses.

692
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:43,212
Minister Katsumoto,
it is with great regret...

693
01:27:44,303 --> 01:27:46,760
... but I must ask you
to remove your sword.

694
01:27:51,269 --> 01:27:53,178
This sword serves the Emperor.

695
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:55,928
Only he can command me to remove it.

696
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:22,708
The Emperor's voice is too pure
to be heard in this council.

697
01:28:24,676 --> 01:28:28,257
Then, I must refuse
to give up my sword.

698
01:28:33,851 --> 01:28:37,301
Then regretfully, my guards will
accompany you to your home in Tokyo.

699
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:40,183
There you will await our summons.

700
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:06,331
I heard you were leaving.

701
01:29:08,133 --> 01:29:11,170
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

702
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:14,468
I suppose I should thank you.

703
01:29:15,014 --> 01:29:19,557
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent...

704
01:29:19,978 --> 01:29:21,805
... in captivity.

705
01:29:23,397 --> 01:29:26,730
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

706
01:29:30,154 --> 01:29:31,612
You're welcome.

707
01:29:36,786 --> 01:29:39,323
Well, it is pretty much over.

708
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:43,874
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

709
01:29:44,043 --> 01:29:48,419
With him dead, we should have
little trouble handling the rebellion...

710
01:29:48,589 --> 01:29:50,332
... even without you.

711
01:29:54,677 --> 01:29:57,003
Especially without you.

712
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:04,182
Just tell me one thing.

713
01:30:04,853 --> 01:30:09,065
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

714
01:31:01,533 --> 01:31:03,858
Save us the trouble... .

715
01:33:53,903 --> 01:33:56,228
The Samurai are finished!

716
01:34:21,931 --> 01:34:23,210
Stop!

717
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,636
Don't come any closer!

718
01:34:24,809 --> 01:34:27,477
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

719
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:32,389
Minister Omura has commanded us
to photograph the traitor--

720
01:34:32,941 --> 01:34:34,435
Stop! Somebody!

721
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,318
Bring that equipment here now!

722
01:34:36,485 --> 01:34:37,861
immediately!

723
01:34:38,029 --> 01:34:39,773
You stop!

724
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:44,117
You insolent, useless son
of a peasant dog!

725
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:50,450
How dare you show your sword in
his presence! Do you know who this is?

726
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:54,166
This is the President
of the United States of America!

727
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:58,542
He is here to lead our armies
in victorious battle against the rebels!

728
01:34:58,716 --> 01:35:00,542
It's not my responsibility... .

729
01:35:00,758 --> 01:35:04,424
Now get over there and
help those men with their equipment!

730
01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:09,260
Carry the equipment.

731
01:35:13,021 --> 01:35:16,141
- President of the United States?
- Sorry.

732
01:35:16,316 --> 01:35:18,107
I think I'm going to be sick.

733
01:35:36,334 --> 01:35:38,374
How's your poem coming?

734
01:35:41,005 --> 01:35:43,876
The end is proving difficult.

735
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:48,000
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

736
01:35:49,514 --> 01:35:51,672
I thought you returned to America.

737
01:35:51,848 --> 01:35:56,510
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.

738
01:35:56,771 --> 01:35:58,894
How do you plan to do that?

739
01:36:07,698 --> 01:36:11,695
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

740
01:36:11,868 --> 01:36:14,074
I would be greatly honored.

741
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:36,569
My Lord, no!

742
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:38,820
Nobutada!

743
01:38:23,827 --> 01:38:26,661
Father, let me stay.

744
01:38:30,707 --> 01:38:32,452
It is my time.

745
01:38:45,805 --> 01:38:47,181
My Lord...

746
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:49,764
... we must go.

747
01:40:12,597 --> 01:40:15,466
The Emperor could not hear my words.

748
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:20,301
His army will come.

749
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:23,514
It is the end.

750
01:40:25,983 --> 01:40:30,527
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

751
01:40:32,198 --> 01:40:34,440
Now...

752
01:40:34,616 --> 01:40:36,325
... I have failed them.

753
01:40:47,879 --> 01:40:51,296
So you will take your own life...

754
01:40:52,843 --> 01:40:54,122
... in shame?

755
01:40:59,307 --> 01:41:02,972
Shame for a life of service?

756
01:41:03,978 --> 01:41:06,765
Discipline? Compassion?

757
01:41:07,564 --> 01:41:11,016
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

758
01:41:11,194 --> 01:41:13,648
Necessary?

759
01:41:15,655 --> 01:41:18,147
What could be more necessary?

760
01:41:22,204 --> 01:41:25,786
I will die by the sword.

761
01:41:27,501 --> 01:41:29,908
My own...

762
01:41:30,086 --> 01:41:31,913
... or my enemy's.

763
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:35,211
Then let it be your enemy's.

764
01:41:38,844 --> 01:41:42,628
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

765
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:14,159
He was a good man.

766
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,583
Will you fight the white men, too?

767
01:42:19,841 --> 01:42:25,215
If they come here, yes.

768
01:42:27,265 --> 01:42:28,677
Why?

769
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:38,565
Because they come to destroy
what I have come to love.

770
01:42:50,121 --> 01:42:58,246
The way of Samurai is difficult
for children. He misses his father.

771
01:42:59,671 --> 01:43:08,046
And he is angry
because I am the cause of that.

772
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:18,602
No. He is angry because
he fears you will die as well.

773
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:44,078
My father taught me
it is glorious to die in battle.

774
01:43:48,509 --> 01:43:55,093
That is what he believed.

775
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:00,349
I would be afraid to die in battle.

776
01:44:02,064 --> 01:44:03,522
So would I.

777
01:44:05,733 --> 01:44:08,224
but you have been in many battles.

778
01:44:10,197 --> 01:44:13,280
And I was always afraid.

779
01:44:20,998 --> 01:44:22,326
I don't want you to go.

780
01:44:23,834 --> 01:44:25,707
Algren.

781
01:44:25,878 --> 01:44:27,159
They are coming.

782
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,566
I'd say two full regiments.

783
01:44:58,743 --> 01:45:01,030
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

784
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:03,203
And they have the howitzers.

785
01:45:03,371 --> 01:45:07,618
It makes no difference. They will come,
and we will make our stand.

786
01:45:07,793 --> 01:45:10,828
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.

787
01:45:11,421 --> 01:45:13,213
Like General Custer, huh?

788
01:45:17,552 --> 01:45:21,550
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

789
01:45:21,722 --> 01:45:25,305
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

790
01:45:25,476 --> 01:45:28,050
A million. You understand this number?

791
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:30,221
I understand this number.

792
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:33,053
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly...

793
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:38,571
... the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

794
01:45:38,739 --> 01:45:42,901
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.

795
01:45:43,117 --> 01:45:46,617
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.

796
01:45:47,789 --> 01:45:49,366
Close enough for a sword.

797
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:53,372
You believe...

798
01:45:53,545 --> 01:45:55,620
... a man can change his destiny?

799
01:45:58,591 --> 01:46:01,758
I think a man does what he can...

800
01:46:01,927 --> 01:46:04,051
... until his destiny is revealed to him.

801
01:46:11,437 --> 01:46:15,102
<i>May 25th, 1877. </i>

802
01:46:15,273 --> 01:46:18,439
<i>This will be the last entry
in this journal. </i>

803
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:23,816
<i>I've tried to give a true accounting
of what I have seen, what I have done. </i>

804
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:27,573
<i>I do not presume to understand
the course of my life. </i>

805
01:46:27,911 --> 01:46:31,955
<i>I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this... </i>

806
01:46:32,122 --> 01:46:34,162
<i>... even if for a moment. </i>

807
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:31,184
Algren-san, will you come with me?

808
01:48:48,168 --> 01:48:51,702
If you wear this armor,
it will honor us.

809
01:51:50,007 --> 01:51:52,877
You will need this.

810
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:06,009
What does it say?

811
01:52:07,107 --> 01:52:12,611
''I belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new. ''

812
01:53:16,631 --> 01:53:19,168
Good God.

813
01:53:22,678 --> 01:53:26,722
Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

814
01:53:27,183 --> 01:53:29,755
If you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

815
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:34,645
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

816
01:53:38,818 --> 01:53:40,727
Captain Algren.

817
01:53:40,904 --> 01:53:42,813
We will show you no quarter.

818
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:45,659
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

819
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:48,699
I'll look for you on the field.

820
01:54:09,473 --> 01:54:10,932
Captain Algren.

821
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:13,721
Mr. Graham.

822
01:54:17,021 --> 01:54:20,391
Perhaps you can use these
for your book.

823
01:54:20,566 --> 01:54:22,973
Yes, I will. Captain.

824
01:54:26,155 --> 01:54:27,899
Godspeed.

825
01:54:29,533 --> 01:54:31,905
Mr. Graham.

826
01:54:55,766 --> 01:54:58,636
Well they won't surrender.

827
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:07,103
Are we ready?

828
01:55:08,988 --> 01:55:10,362
Get into your positions!

829
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:57,567
Commence firing!

830
01:57:13,438 --> 01:57:16,012
- They're covering their retreat.
- You see?

831
01:57:16,191 --> 01:57:19,940
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

832
01:57:20,111 --> 01:57:23,314
- Signal the attack.
- I advise sending in skirmishers first.

833
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:25,483
Nonsense! Full attack!

834
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:23,452
They're coming.

835
01:58:55,828 --> 01:58:57,701
Wait for the volley.

836
01:59:09,507 --> 01:59:11,334
Second volley.

837
02:00:06,103 --> 02:00:08,390
- What on earth?
- What is happening?

838
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:56,521
- The attack has been stopped.
- Send in the rest of the regiment.

839
02:01:01,488 --> 02:01:03,776
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

840
02:01:04,157 --> 02:01:06,944
Dead to the last man.

841
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:11,755
Algren-san!

842
02:05:00,257 --> 02:05:03,092
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

843
02:06:07,319 --> 02:06:11,233
They'll bring two more regiments
up here soon.

844
02:06:11,407 --> 02:06:13,447
We won't be able to stop them again.

845
02:06:14,451 --> 02:06:16,528
You do not have to die here.

846
02:06:19,582 --> 02:06:22,333
I should have died
so many times before.

847
02:06:22,877 --> 02:06:24,287
Now, you live again.

848
02:06:27,548 --> 02:06:29,754
Yes.

849
02:06:31,926 --> 02:06:34,881
It was not your time.

850
02:06:38,265 --> 02:06:40,554
It's not over.

851
02:07:26,854 --> 02:07:28,264
What is this?

852
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:29,981
Cannon, prepare to fire!

853
02:07:30,357 --> 02:07:31,850
Prepare to fire!

854
02:07:32,525 --> 02:07:36,854
- This is madness. He's going to attack?
- Yes.

855
02:07:45,162 --> 02:07:48,198
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

856
02:08:00,177 --> 02:08:02,585
Kill him. All of them.

857
02:08:02,762 --> 02:08:05,169
Now!

858
02:08:09,227 --> 02:08:10,555
My horse!

859
02:09:03,487 --> 02:09:04,767
Fire!

860
02:09:41,773 --> 02:09:43,102
Ready!

861
02:09:46,486 --> 02:09:47,767
Aim!

862
02:09:53,116 --> 02:09:54,446
Fire!

863
02:10:00,625 --> 02:10:02,119
Fire at will!

864
02:10:48,295 --> 02:10:50,252
bring up the new guns!

865
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,339
Prepare the new guns!

866
02:10:57,303 --> 02:10:59,129
Fire!

867
02:11:01,182 --> 02:11:02,510
backward!

868
02:11:05,519 --> 02:11:07,677
Quickly! Quickly!

869
02:11:11,190 --> 02:11:12,768
Fire!

870
02:12:57,375 --> 02:12:58,785
Stop firing!

871
02:12:59,126 --> 02:13:00,954
idiots, keep on firing!

872
02:13:01,128 --> 02:13:02,789
Stop firing! Stop!

873
02:13:12,472 --> 02:13:13,932
No.

874
02:13:15,309 --> 02:13:18,844
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!

875
02:13:21,022 --> 02:13:23,773
You have your honor again.

876
02:13:25,986 --> 02:13:28,228
Let me die with mine.

877
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,656
Help me up.

878
02:13:59,267 --> 02:14:00,974
Are you ready?

879
02:14:08,108 --> 02:14:11,774
I will miss our conversations.

880
02:14:58,323 --> 02:15:00,649
Perfect.

881
02:15:07,249 --> 02:15:10,452
They are all...

882
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:13,584
... perfect.

883
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:45,335
<i>On behalf of the United States
of America... </i>

884
02:16:46,259 --> 02:16:51,501
... the signing of this treaty will usher in
an era of unprecedented prosperity...

885
02:16:51,681 --> 02:16:55,808
... and cooperation between
our two great nations.

886
02:16:56,142 --> 02:16:57,850
On behalf of the Emperor...

887
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:01,804
... we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this...

888
02:17:05,193 --> 02:17:07,481
... negotiation.

889
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,862
He is here?

890
02:18:21,307 --> 02:18:24,177
Highness, if we could just conclude
the matter at hand... .

891
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:54,505
This is Katsumoto's sword.

892
02:18:55,839 --> 02:18:58,544
He would have wanted you to have it...

893
02:18:59,718 --> 02:19:02,803
... that the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

894
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:08,639
Enlightened One,
we all weep for Katsumoto, but--

895
02:19:08,853 --> 02:19:10,430
He hoped...

896
02:19:11,062 --> 02:19:13,269
... with his last breath...

897
02:19:13,649 --> 02:19:17,017
... that you would remember the
ancestors who held this sword...

898
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:21,109
... and what they died for.

899
02:19:22,489 --> 02:19:24,282
Your Highness... .

900
02:19:41,342 --> 02:19:43,547
You were with him...

901
02:19:44,719 --> 02:19:46,795
... at the end?

902
02:19:52,185 --> 02:19:55,636
Emperor, this man fought against you!

903
02:19:59,859 --> 02:20:01,483
Your Highness...

904
02:20:02,736 --> 02:20:07,315
... if you believe me to be your enemy,
command me...

905
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:09,779
... and I will gladly take my life.

906
02:20:23,923 --> 02:20:28,004
I have dreamed of a unified Japan...

907
02:20:28,177 --> 02:20:33,966
... of a country strong
and independent and modern.

908
02:20:34,142 --> 02:20:39,930
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

909
02:20:41,898 --> 02:20:43,524
but...

910
02:20:46,903 --> 02:20:50,947
... we cannot forget who we are...

911
02:20:52,408 --> 02:20:56,905
... or where we come from.

912
02:21:09,299 --> 02:21:11,873
Ambassador Swanbeck...

913
02:21:12,052 --> 02:21:14,888
... I have concluded that your treaty...

914
02:21:15,055 --> 02:21:19,882
... is not in the best interest
of my people.

915
02:21:20,643 --> 02:21:24,262
- Sir, if I may--
- So sorry...

916
02:21:24,648 --> 02:21:26,438
... but you may not.

917
02:21:26,774 --> 02:21:30,109
This is an outrage!

918
02:21:36,117 --> 02:21:37,576
Enlightened One,
we should discuss this--

919
02:21:37,743 --> 02:21:39,119
Omura...

920
02:21:39,286 --> 02:21:41,445
... you have done quite enough.

921
02:21:41,705 --> 02:21:44,327
Everything I have done,
I have done for my country.

922
02:21:44,499 --> 02:21:47,454
Then you will not mind
when I seize your family's assets...

923
02:21:47,712 --> 02:21:50,284
... and present them
as my gift to the people.

924
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:52,789
You disgrace me.

925
02:21:53,007 --> 02:21:55,047
If your shame is too unbearable...

926
02:22:04,435 --> 02:22:05,894
... I offer you this sword.

927
02:22:36,675 --> 02:22:39,212
Tell me how he died.

928
02:22:46,975 --> 02:22:51,519
I will tell you how he lived.

929
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:05,193
<i>And so the days
of the Samurai had ended. </i>

930
02:23:05,367 --> 02:23:10,907
<i>Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny. </i>

931
02:23:11,999 --> 02:23:14,573
<i>As for the American captain... </i>

932
02:23:14,752 --> 02:23:17,077
<i>... no one knows what became of him. </i>

933
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:20,705
<i>Some say that he died of his wounds... </i>

934
02:23:20,885 --> 02:23:24,833
<i>... others, that he returned
to his own country. </i>

935
02:23:25,012 --> 02:23:26,638
<i>But I like to think... </i>

936
02:23:26,805 --> 02:23:31,882
<i>... he may have at last found
some small measure of peace... </i>

937
02:23:32,062 --> 02:23:34,055
<i>... that we all seek... </i>

938
02:23:34,815 --> 02:23:37,982
<i>... and few of us ever find. </i>
